# Sphinx-UE4
Sphinx-UE4 is a speech recognition plugin for Unreal Engine 4. 
The plugin makes use of the Pocketsphinx library.

<b>Note:</b> 
This plugin uses a slightly modified version of PocketSphinx, to support passing in a set of keywords, dynamically.
The modified code is contained within the _other folder.

This repo is forked form https://github.com/shanecolb/sphinx-ue4 and some other pices of code form https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/plugin-speech-recognition/43703 
I am basically having some issues with Andriod build, I fixed most bugs and got it working with UE4 4.27.2 But after i have packaged it will stop detecting, works fine in debug mode. 

if anyone is able to resolve it please let me know
